* Install cygwin packages
	* Command Prompt
		* cd C:\cygwin64

	* Click new and write "C:\cygwin64\bin"

* Install Anaconda
	* Check the "Add to PATH" option.
	* If you want to use any other python than the one Anaconda installs, you need to figure how to access it in cygwin - activate seems to be bugged at time moment.


* Use ProSHADE from Command Prompt :-)

* Install CMake
	* Download 64-bit MSI installer from https://cmake.org/download
	* Check either of the "Add to PATH" options.

	* Check the "Desktop development with C++" option.

	* mkdir build
	* cd .\build
	* cmake ..\proshade\proshade
