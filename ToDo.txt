To Do:

Problems
* [Currently Disabled Feature] Progressive sphere mapping for rotation still have memory leak in shell 9...
* [Bug] Manually setting high band crashes or leads to 0 results.
* [Bug] Running the same structure distance computation more than twice leads to the consecutive comparisons not having trace sigma and rotation function distance 1.

Development
* Timing - are band and integration order correctly determined?
* Timing - can it be faster?
* Get new version to CCP-EM including new interface
* Support non-orthogonal maps
* Make sure the SO(3) coefficients are accessed from python just like the E matrices.

!!!
* Create pip installation
