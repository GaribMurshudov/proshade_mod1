To Do:

Testing:
* Look into symmetry and improve on time and accuracy
* Look into the limits of structure overlay

Development
* Timing - are band and integration order correctly determined?
* Timing - can it be faster?
* Support non-orthogonal maps
* Make sure the SO(3) coefficients are accessed from python just like the E matrices.
* Use NFFT?
* Create Homebrew build procedure for MacOS
* Create apt build procedure for Linux
* Create PyPi module for Windows
* Create MacPorts build procedure
