To Do:

Development
* Timing - are band and integration order correctly determined?
* Timing - can it be faster?
* Support non-orthogonal maps
* Make sure the SO(3) coefficients are accessed from python just like the E matrices.
* Allow resolution change by computing Fourier and using only correct number of coefficients.

Admin
* Create pip installation
* Get new version to CCP-EM including new interface
