* Timing - can it be faster?
* Support non-orthogonal maps
* Make sure the SO(3) coefficients are accessed from python just like the E matrices.
* Use NFFT
* Look into symmetry and improve on time and accuracy
* Create PiPy build procedure for python modules
* Create Homebrew build procedure for MacOS
* Create apt build procedure for Linux
* Create Windows binary and dll to go with PiPy for complete Windows installation
